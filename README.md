# Pyber_Analysis
Pyber project
## Overview:
Total sum of the fare is supposed to be calcualated as per city type and in weekly manner. Finally with the help of graph and data we need to summarize how data differes by city type and how those differences can be used by decision makers at PyBer.
## Results:
- The ride sharing dataframe for first 10 values is shown below:

- Total 2375 values are included in the dataframe consisting three city types namely "Rural", "Suburban" and "Urban."
- Total numbers of drivers, total fare amoount, total rides, average fare amount, average fare per driver per city type were calculated and shown in table below:

- According tho the figure above the total rides, Total fares, and total drivers count was the most for urban city type and the least for rural city type. On the outher hand the   avrage fare per ride and aerage fare per driver was the least for urban city type and most for rural city type.
- According to this data we can say that beacause of the expensive fare ride in rural areas the total rides were happend less and also becayse of less number of drivers the average fare price was increased.
- The datetimeindex dataframe and line chart of total fares per week for each city type is shown below:

- According to above figures total weekly fare accumulated for urban city typse were the most and for rural city types were the least. The months of February to mid- April had hikes of fare collection.

## Summary:
- To inccrease the fare acumulation to rural areas there are three things can be done:
  1. Decrease the fare price to certain level.
  2. Increase the number of drivers to rural areas so that more fare rides could happen.
  3. Increase number of rides in rural areas with less fare price especially in the months of February to mid_April.
